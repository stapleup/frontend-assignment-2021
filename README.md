# The Assignment

We need a new way of displaying the posts that an influencer has added to a campaign. As such we have a design for a new component, the 'Post details component'
This component will

- Display the images related to the post at the top. If there is one image, a single image will be shown, if there are two or more, then a carousel
- The top carousel is not shown in the designs, it is up to you how to implement this visually
- Display the influencer image, name & handle
- Display the post date in a readable format
- Display the formatted data points in a grid below, with impressions & reach as a number and engagement as a percentage
- The component should be displayed in a grid of 3 on the page
- The page should be responsive down to 750px minimum desktop width

This component is based on something we already have in the UI, as such please base your implementation of some existing screenshots we have included.
Using the attached shots, and the attached sample data JSON. Please create this new component & display it in a grid on a page, rendering the sample JSON.

Please submit your assignment in a zip via email to us & include a small description of what you did and why. We will go into more detail in your assigment in a follow up interview.

We will award extra points if you can demonstrate one or more of the following abilities

- Clean & commented code
- Use of ES6/7 Javascript
- Responsive design using flex or grid
- Nice interactions/animations
- Reusable code blocks

You are free to use any libraries on top you would like, excluding UI libraries. For the component & page layouts please use pure CSS.
Good luck!
